## Description

The **Drift Mod** allows you to experience a more realistic and exciting drifting feature in **GTA: San Andreas** multiplayer using **SA:MP**. This version, built using **MoonLoader**, offers smoother performance and enhanced control compared to the old **CLEO** version. With better handling of in-game mechanics, it provides a more responsive and immersive drifting experience.

## Features
- Enable or disable drift mode using the `/drift` command.
- Enhanced control over your vehicle's rotation during drift.
- Car collision temporarily turns off while drifting.
- Drift activated only when moving at speeds over 5.0 units.

## How to Use

1. After installing the mod, launch **SA:MP** with **MoonLoader**.
2. Type `/drift` in the in-game chat to toggle drift mode on or off.
3. When drift mode is enabled:
   - Hold **[Left Shift]** to initiate drifting when your car is on all wheels and moving.
   - Use **[A]** to rotate the car to the left, and **[D]** to rotate to the right.
